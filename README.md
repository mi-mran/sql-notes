Compiled SQL Notes & Examples :shipit:
=======================================

A personal reference for SQL concepts and commands for times when I walk into a restaurant and forget which tables I can join.

## Spreadsheets VS Databases

| Differences   | Pros          | Cons        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:| :-----------:|
| Spreadsheets  | easy to learn, accessible, easy to modify | varying truth versions, easy to make editing mistakes, no audit trail |
| Databases     | used when scope is beyond single table, single repo used by multiple users, limit duplication, logical relations      |         not as easily accessible / learnable as spreadsheets |

## Relational VS Non-relational (NoSQL) DBs

| Differences        | Features      |
|:-------------:     |:-------------:|
| Relational         | table-like data structure, set of tables for related data, set of logic governing tables |
| Non-relational     | effective for unstructured data |
